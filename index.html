                        <p> The Park Güell is a public park system composed of gardens and architectonic elements located on Carmel Hill.
                            UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site and it is one of these things that you just have to see when you’re in Barcelona.
                            It takes a little longer to get ther from the nearest underground stop. 
                            
                            The park itself has no admission and is open to public,
                            but there’s a part with the colorful mosaics that you’ll need to get a ticket for.
                            You can even get it on the same day as when you’ll be going. But it is only

                            certain number of people permitted there at time, so you’ll be given a time slot.</p>

                                The show means that the fountain is coordinated with the light and music. Then on Plaza
                                Espanya you also
                                have National Art museum of Catalunya and Arenas. Arenas are old bullfighting ring. When

                                this one was converted in the shopping mall. Here you can go on the roof and there’s a

                        <p>you mentioned that you’ll be staying in L'Eixample so you’ll be probably staying close to
                            Passage de Gracia. It is just a long street on which you can find a few Gaudi’s buildings (which are definitely
                            photo worthy). </p>
                            <p>
                            When you’ll be walking down the street, you’ll first see Casa Batlo and then La Pedrera
                            These ar all museums so if you want to visit, you’ll need to get a ticket. I’ve never been inside so I don’t know if is
                            worth it or not. The street also has many designer shops on it. When you’ll keep walking, you’ll get to Plaza
                            Catalunya which is
                            big transit hub (with underground stops, bus stops, airport shuttle and so on). When you’ll
                            keep walking down the street, you’ll get to famous la Rambla which is dividing the Old Town (it is a border
                            between Barri Gòtic and Raval). 
                            </p>
                            <p>I advise against eating or drinking at la Rambla. It’s a tourist trap and
                            everything
                            there
                            is just
                            overpriced. In the middle of La Rambla is the Boqueria market – definitely worth visiting.
                            They have
                            everything
                            there, from fruits, vegies, meats, fresh seafood to prepared little snacks, and smoothies,
                            and puffy
                            pastries and
                            it’s just amazing. When you’ll keep walking down the street you’ll get to the seaside and a
                            marina.

        <h4>Blai 9</h4>
        <p>on Blai street in Poble Sec. This little street is full of pinchos and tapas places. Blai 9 is particularly
            nice
            because it is in a form of buffet, and you just pay for what you eat, and all the food is also beautifully
            styled. </p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h4>Champaneria</h4>
    <p>yit’s a cava bar in el Born. Cava is basically Catalan champagne, they have different drinks too, but I recommend
        trying local cava when you’ll be there. You can also order appetizers like local olives, or cheeses … Everything
        you order can also buy in the deli section at the back. All is very good and surprisingly inexpensive</p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h4>Chatelet</h4>
    <p>just a nice bar in Gracia which may be close to where you’ll be staying</p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h4>Taller de Tapas </h4>
    <p>just a nice tapas place, there are multiple locations around the city and one is in Eixample</p>
