                        <p> Parc Guell is a park designed by Gaudi and is quite unexpected.

                            It is one of these things that you just have to see when you’re in Barcelona.
                            Park is bit higher in the hilly part it takes a little longer to get there
                            from the nearest underground stop. The park itself has no admission and is open to public,
                            but there’s a part with the colorful mosaics that you’ll need to get a ticket for.
                            You can even get it on the same day as when you’ll be going. But it is only

                            certain number of people permitted there at time, so you’ll be given a time slot.</p>

                                The show means that the fountain is coordinated with the light and music. Then on Plaza
                                Espanya you also
                                have National Art museum of Catalunya and Arenas. Arenas are old bullfighting ring. When

                                this one was converted in the shopping mall. Here you can go on the roof and there’s a

                        <p>you mentioned that you’ll be staying in L'Eixample so you’ll be probably staying close to
                            Passage de Gracia. It is just a long street on which you can find a few Gaudi’s buildings (which are definitely
                            photo worthy). </p>
                            <p>
                            When you’ll be walking down the street, you’ll first see Casa Batlo and then La Pedrera
                            These ar all museums so if you want to visit, you’ll need to get a ticket. I’ve never been inside so I don’t know if is
                            worth it or not. The street also has many designer shops on it. When you’ll keep walking, you’ll get to Plaza
                            Catalunya which is
                            big transit hub (with underground stops, bus stops, airport shuttle and so on). When you’ll
                            keep walking down the street, you’ll get to famous la Rambla which is dividing the Old Town (it is a border
                            between Barri Gòtic and Raval). 
                            </p>
                            <p>I advise against eating or drinking at la Rambla. It’s a tourist trap and
                            everything
                            there
                            is just
                            overpriced. In the middle of La Rambla is the Boqueria market – definitely worth visiting.
                            They have
                            everything
                            there, from fruits, vegies, meats, fresh seafood to prepared little snacks, and smoothies,
                            and puffy
                            pastries and
                            it’s just amazing. When you’ll keep walking down the street you’ll get to the seaside and a
                            marina.

                <h4>Parqc de Cuitadela and Arc de Triumf </h4>

                <p>It is just a park and it is just an arch, but they are both pretty and very Instagram-able
                    and one of these things that pop up when you search Barcelona. </p>
            </div>
            <br>


            <h3 id="views"> The Views</h3>

            <div class="container">
                <h4>Tibidabo</h4>
                <p>is the mountain above Barcelona with beautiful overview of the city. At the top there’s a temple of
                    the Sacred Heart of Jesus which looks like a Disney Castle. There’s also amusement park. To get
                    there
                    you’ll have
                    to take I think underground and funicular but the view from up there is pretty amazing. Also,
                    there’s
                    amusement park there. </p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <div class="container">
                <h4>Montjuic Castle</h4>
                <p>you can take either bus or cable car to get there</p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <div class="container">
                <h4>Bunkers </h4>
                <p>these are the old bunkers above the city. I usually just took a bottle of wine or cava up there and
                    watched sunset.
                    The only downside is that it is bit of a hike from the metro (about 30 minutes up steep uphill) and
                    it
                    may be bit confusing to get there…but the view is worth it. </p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="food">Food & Drinks</h3>

            <h4>Boqueria Market</h4>
            <p>it is one of my favorite food places in the city just because it has bit of everything, and it is
                amazing.
                Just a small piece of advice when you enter don’t shop from the first stalls, these are for some reason
                pricier and you can probably find what you wanted somewhere, further back. </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <h4>Blai 9</h4>
        <p>on Blai street in Poble Sec. This little street is full of pinchos and tapas places. Blai 9 is particularly
            nice
            because it is in a form of buffet, and you just pay for what you eat, and all the food is also beautifully
            styled. </p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h4>Champaneria</h4>
    <p>yit’s a cava bar in el Born. Cava is basically Catalan champagne, they have different drinks too, but I recommend
        trying local cava when you’ll be there. You can also order appetizers like local olives, or cheeses … Everything
        you order can also buy in the deli section at the back. All is very good and surprisingly inexpensive</p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h4>Chatelet</h4>
    <p>just a nice bar in Gracia which may be close to where you’ll be staying</p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h4>Taller de Tapas </h4>
    <p>just a nice tapas place, there are multiple locations around the city and one is in Eixample</p>
    </div>
